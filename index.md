## Project Outline
The Hawaii Annual Code Challenge is a month long hackathon where teams put together software products that fulfil a certain need and criteria. [HACC Hui](https://hacc-hui.github.io/) was a Meteor application produced in Fall 2020 that solved the prior ad-hoc and informal team formation of the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. It was a repository that stored team information, profile information for each user, allows integration with Slack, and gave HACC administrators tools to better facilitate the competition. The repository for HACC Hui can be found [here](https://github.com/HACC-Hui/HACC-Hui).

## Project Goals
### 1. Update Tech Stack
Currently, HACC Hui has not been updated since its inception three years ago and the technology is outdated. <br/>**Goal:** Update Meteor, React, and replace Semantic UI with Bootstrap.
### 2. Automate Database Reset
There is no concise way of clearing the database in order for the repository to be fresh for a new year of competition. <br/>**Goal:** Allow administrators the ability to easily reset the database of teams and user profiles.
### 3. Test Suite Validation
HACC Hui is currently not passing the test units. <br/>**Goal:** Ensure the updated site passes all test units.
